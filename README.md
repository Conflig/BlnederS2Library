Instal this this plugin in to Blender 
Than use this tool to create list of the Source2 materials 
Hit "Create Material button" 
DONE! 

(if you cannot see some preview images in the material library go tho the outliner and access the blend file data. That select all the material right click / clean and then click "Mark as asset". It will take few minutes)
